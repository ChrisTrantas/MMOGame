In threading:
Create a buffer that the network manager writes to and everything else reads to
The network manager shouldn't time out

Create a struct that has all of the elements in the buffer so that we don't have to create the weird buf movement. 
We instead cast the buf into a struct and set its memory to the struct. ex. struct* jim = {int, int, string}; jim = (struct jim*)buf;

Create a broadcast protocal instead of a threaded model. Go back to a single thread for a while
